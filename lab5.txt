==========

Exercise 1: Single or Double Quotes - Does it matter?

Example, "haven't" or '"Spam, spam, spam," he said.'

>>> type('Hello')
<class 'str'>
>>> type("goodbye")
<class 'str'>
>>> 'This is a string' 
'This is a string'
>>> "" (An empty string - type two quotes with no spaces between them.) 
''
>>> '"Spam, spam, spam," he said.'
'"Spam, spam, spam," he said.'
>>> "I haven't a clue"
"I haven't a clue"
>>> 'I haven't a clue' 
invalid syntax

Concluding Questions: Generally, either double or single quotes works well but can you give a scenario where one is better than the other?
when there is an apostrophie in the string use double quotes to eliminate confusion. 
when there is a quote inside the string use single quotes to eliminate confusion.

Exercise 2: What operations are permitted with values of type str?

When used with strings, + is the concatenation operator. 

>>> 'Hello, ' + 'world!'
Hello, world!
When used with strings, * is the replication operator.

>>> "Spam" * 3
SpamSpamSpam
>>> 3 * "Spam"
SpamSpamSpam
>>> "Spam" * 0
''
>>> "Spam" * -3
''
There are other operators to try now: - and /

>>> "Hello" - "He"
error
>>> 'Spam' / 3
error

Concluding Questions: What operators work with strings?  Does the order of operands matter?
depends if your using / operand or the - operand they dont work. but they work with the * operand and the + operand
no, the order doesnt matter

Exercise 3 : Understand the string representation

Is  the string '123' the same as the integer 123? 

>>> '123' + 456 
error
>>> '123' + '456'
'123456'
Concluding Question: When a string looks like a number, is it a number or a string?
a string
